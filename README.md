## Quick Start

This quick start guide assumes you have [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installed and a CUDA-capable GPU available. See [Installation](#installation) for full details and a container solution using Singularity.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```console
git clone https://github.com/dieterich-lab/QutRNA2
cd QutRNA2
```

**2. Install and activate the environment:**
```console
conda env create -f conda.yaml -n qutrna2
conda activate qutrna2
```

**3. Copy and edit the example config files:**

```console
cp examples/analysis/map_with_gpu.yaml my_analysis.yaml
cp examples/data/sprinzl_cm.yaml my_data.yaml
```

Edit `my_data.yaml` to point to your reference FASTA [examples](https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/genomes/eukaryota/Hsapi19/Hsapi19-seq.html), sample description TSV (labels and filepaths to basecalled samples) [example](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/QutRNA2/blob/main/examples/sample_table_fastq.tsv), and Sprinzl coordinate labels [example for eukaryotic cytosolic tRNA](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/QutRNA2/blob/main/data/nuclear-euk-masked.txt).
Edit `my_analysis.yaml` to set paths for JACUSA2 and gpu-tRNA-mapper, and any GPU init commands.

**4. Run a dry run to verify the workflow:**
```console
snakemake \
    -c 1 \
    --snakefile <QUTRNA2_LOCAL_DIR>/workflow/Snakefile \
    --use-conda \
    --configfiles my_analysis.yaml \
    --config pepfile=my_data.yaml \
    --directory <ANALYSIS_OUTPUT> \
    -n
```

A list of jobs to be executed should appear. If it does without errors, remove `-n` and increase `-c` to the number of available cores to start the analysis.

## New Features

QutRNA2 features the novel GPU-assisted [gpu-tRNA-mapper](https://github.com/fkallen/gpu-tRNA-mapper) that performs up to 25x faster than the previously used mapper [parasail](https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail) for the same task. Furthermore, a new, improved version of [JACUSA v2.1.16](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/JACUSA2/releases/download/v2.1.16/JACUSA_v2.1.16.jar) is included, featuring subsampled scores that improve the signal-to-noise ratio for identifying tRNA modifications.

Finally, a filter framework has been added to the analysis workflow to remove spurious alignments by applying the following filters:

* Filter Random alignments
* Filter Adapter overlap (with 5' and 3' splint adapters)
* Filter multimapping reads

We added the following plots to assess the impact of filtering:

* Alignment threshold summary plot
* Impact of filters on read length
* Impact of filters on the number of reads

More customization options for heatmap plots:

* Filter tRNAs by min. number of reads
* Display or ignore specific tRNAs by regular expression
* Mark positions of interest
* Use patterns to customize the title of heatmap plots

## Requirements
To use GPU-assisted mapping, you need a compatible NVIDIA GPU. For details, check [Hardware requirements](https://github.com/fkallen/gpu-tRNA-mapper?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-requirements).
In brief, a CUDA-capable GPU with Volta architecture or newer is recommended.

If no compatible GPU is present, QutRNA2 can be used with [parasail](https://github.com/jeffdaily/parasail) but will run significantly slower. See [below](#setup-analysis-configuration).

## Installation

### Environment setup using Conda

We provide a conda file with all necessary packages. 
Clone the repository and install the requirements with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

Go to your desired `<QUTRNA2-LOCAL-DIR>` and clone the repository:
```console
cd <QUTRNA2-LOCAL-DIR>
git clone https://github.com/dieterich-lab/QutRNA2
```

Next, install all the requirements: 
```console
cd QutRNA2
conda env create -f conda.yaml -n qutrna2
```

Finally, activate the environment:
```console
conda activate qutrna2
```
### Using Singularity container

If Singularity/Apptainer is not already available on your system, see the [SingularityCE](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/latest/admin-guide/installation.html) or [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/latest/installation.html) installation guides.

#### Use the pre-built container image

The Zenodo link in our manuscript contains a pre-built container image. You can download it, [set up your config files](#setup-qutrna2-analysis), and run it as [instructed here](#run-using-the-container).

#### Build your own container image

A Singularity definition file is provided at [`singularity/qutrna2.def`](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/QutRNA2/blob/main/singularity/qutrna2.def) to build a portable container image as follows:

```console
singularity build qutrna2.sif singularity/qutrna2.def
```

> Note: building a Singularity image typically requires root or `--fakeroot` privileges (e.g. `singularity build --fakeroot qutrna2.sif singularity/qutrna2.def`)
> If building on an HPC cluster, check whether `--fakeroot` is supported.

## Setup QutRNA2 analysis
QutRNA2 uses YAML files to define the data (data.yaml) and parametrize the analysis (analysis.yaml). Finally, a TSV file provides the sample description.

In summary, the sample description `<SAMPLE_DESC>` must be a TAB-separated file and contain the following columns:

| condition | sample_name | subsample_name | base_calling | fastq\|bam |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| ...       | ...         | ...            | ...          | ...        |

See the files in the `QutRNA2/examples` folder for documented YAML and toy examples for sample tables. Note that the column `base_calling` is a legacy field and should be set to `pass` for all rows.
QutRNA2 distinguishes the configuration of the analysis and the data. The following analysis types are supported: 

* map reads with gpu-tRNA-mapper (see `QutRNA2/examples/analysis/map_with_gpu.yaml`),
* map reads with parasail (see `QutRNA2/examples/analysis/map_with_parasail.yaml`), and
* use exisiting mapping (see `QutRNA2/examples/analysis/existing_mapping.yaml`.

QutRNA2 supports the following approaches to assign Sprinzl coordinates and the configuration of data input differs based on it:

* using a covarince model and secondary structure alignment (see `QutRNA2/examples/data/sprinzl_cm.yaml`),
* using an existing aligned FASTA file (see `QutRNA2/examples/data/sprinzl_afasta.yaml`), or
* a direct mapping of sequence to Sprinzl coordinates (see `QutRNA2/examples/data/seq_to_sprinzl.yaml`)).

Those files are templates and must be adjusted to the user's needs.

## Setup data configuration
First, define your `<SAMPLE_DESC>`. This file holds sample-specific information, such as "condition", "sample_name", "subsample", and "fastq" or "bam" - they directly correspond to columns - see `examples/sample_desc_fastq.tsv`.
Data for entries with the same "sample_name" will be merged - they represent technical replicates. For historical reasons, the column "base_calling" is present. Set it to "pass". Finally, the column "fastq" should point to the path of the compressed (gzip) fastq file.

Second, define your `<DATA_YAML>`. This file describes what reference and Sprinzl coordinates (if any) to use. See `examples/data/*.yaml`. Make sure to add your `<SAMPLE_DESC>`. Provide "ref_fasta" and define what Sprinzl coordinates to use and the size of the adapters used! Correct adapter lengths are essential!

### Sprinzl
For eukaryotic nuclear tRNAs, we use the covariance model [TRNAinf-euk.cm](https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tRAX/blob/master/TRNAinf-euk.cm) and corresponding labels in `data/nuclear-euk-masked.txt`.

**Using a covariance model:** In your data YAML, set `qutrna2.sprinzl.cm` and then provide exactly one of the following:
- `qutrna2.sprinzl.labels` (or `qutrna2.sprinzl.label`) to use an existing labels file
- `qutrna2.sprinzl.scheme` with one of `euk`, `arch`, `bact`, `mito` to generate labels from the CM alignment

For human mt-tRNAs, use the sequence to Sprinzl mapping from [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18068-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18068-6), available in: `data/human_mt_seq_to_sprinzl.tsv` and `data/human_mt_sprinzl_labels.txt`.

It is crucial to obtain covariance models for the organism and tRNAs studied. These models can be acquired, for example, from [https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tRNAscan-SE/tree/master/lib/models](https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tRNAscan-SE/tree/master/lib/models).

## Setup analysis configuration
Finally, define `<ANALYSIS_YAML>`. Here, the workflow is manipulated, and custom plots are defined. Check `examples/analysis/*.yaml` for examples. For the recommended GPU run, use `examples/analysis//map_with_gpu.yaml` as your template. Use `examples/analysis/map_with_parasail.yaml` instead as a template if you don't use GPU and would like to use parasail, but expect significantly longer runtimes.

Add any necessary init code for the GPU and provide paths for JACUSA2 and gpu-tRNA-mapper if they are not in the standard path.

## Examples

## Execute workflow

### Run using the Conda environment
If not done yet, activate qutrna2 conda environment:
```console
conda activate qutrna2
```

Use `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>` folder to define where QutRNA2 should write the output to:
```console
snakemake \
    -c 1 \
    --snakefile <QUTRNA2_LOCAL_DIR>/workflow/Snakefile \
    --use-conda \
    --configfiles <ANALYSIS_YAML> \
        --config pepfile=<DATA_YAML> \
        --directory <ANALYSIS_OUTPUT> \
    -n
```
The `-n` is to do a dry run of the pipeline. You should see a list of necessary jobs to be run and hopefully no errors.
You should increase `-c 1` to whatever suits your computing machine.

if you have no errors and a clean dry run, you can start the analysis (remove `-n`):

```console
snakemake \
    -c 1 \
    --snakefile <QUTRNA2_LOCAL_DIR>/workflow/Snakefile \
    --use-conda \
    --configfiles <ANALYSIS_YAML> \
        --config pepfile=<DATA_YAML> \
        --directory <ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>
```

### Run using the container

The Snakemake command is now the same as above but without `--use-conda`, and it is called as part of a Singularity command:

```console
singularity run \
  --nv \
  --bind <HOST_DATA_DIR>:<HOST_DATA_DIR> \
  <PATH_TO_SIF>/qutrna2.sif \
  snakemake \
    --cores <N_CORES> \
    --snakefile <QUTRNA2_LOCAL_DIR>/workflow/Snakefile \
    --configfiles <ANALYSIS_YAML> \
        --config pepfile=<DATA_YAML> \
        --directory <ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>
```

- `singularity run --nv` enables GPU access inside the container (required for gpu-tRNA-mapper).
- `singularity run --bind` mounts a host directory into the container so input/output paths remain accessible. Bind all directories referenced in your YAML configs or a parent directory.
- `snakemake --executor local` is recommended when running inside a SLURM job (i.e. resource allocation is already handled by SLURM). Set `--cores` to the number of cores allocated to your job (e.g. `$SLURM_CPUS_ON_NODE`).

## Results
When the analysis is finished, the `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>` directory will contain the following subdirectories:
"data", "info", "logs", and "results".

`<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/data/` will contain all unprocessed data used in the analysis.
`<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/info/` will contain runtime information and the configuration files used to track parameters.
`<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/logs/` will contain logs for executed jobs.
`<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/` will contain all calculations.

### data
The directory `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/data` will contain processed instances of the reference sequence.

### Alignments
Alignments are stored in `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/bam/<read-type>/...`. `<read-type>` corresponds to mapped, filtered, and final reads. The BAMs in the subdirectory "final" are used to calculate JACUSA2 score profiles.
Each subdirectory is organised according to "sample_name", "subsample_name", and "base_calling" columns from `<SAMPLE_DESC>`.

### cmalign
If a covariance model was provided in `<DATA_YAML>`, the secondary structure alignment under `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/cmalign/align.stk` will be generated.

### jacusa2
The directory `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/jacusa2` will contain JACUSA2 results for defined contrasts.

## Plots
The directory `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/plots` will contain plots. These are heatmaps of the JACUSA2 scores across tRNA positions or all tRNAs that the reads were mapped to and retained after filtering.

Check `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/plots/scores/cond1~{cond1}/cond2~{cond1}/{id}/bam~final/heatmap.pdf`. This plot concludes the analysis.

### stats
If filters were applied, the directory `<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/stats` will contain summary statistics for features such as alignment score, read length, and read count.

### secondary structure (ss)
`<ANALYSIS_OUTPUT>/results/seq_to_sprinzl_filtered.tsv` will contain the sequence to sprinzl mapping.
